# Keras Hub Colab Notebooks

This repository contains two Google Colab notebooks implementing small variations of Keras Hub examples across different levels: Easy, Intermediate, Advanced, and Expert.

📌 Notebooks Included

1️⃣ Image-Based Colab Notebook 🖼️

Contains implementations of various image-based deep learning models using TensorFlow Hub:

Easy: Image Classification with MobileNetV2

Loads a pre-trained MobileNetV2 model.

Fine-tunes it on a small custom dataset (e.g., hand gestures, animals, etc.).

Intermediate: Object Detection with Faster R-CNN

Uses the Faster R-CNN model from TensorFlow Hub.

Detects objects in images and returns bounding boxes and labels.

Advanced: Super-Resolution with ESRGAN

Enhances low-resolution images using ESRGAN (Enhanced Super-Resolution GAN).

Expert: StyleGAN for Image Generation

Generates synthetic images using a StyleGAN model.

2️⃣ Text-Based Colab Notebook 📝

Contains implementations of various text-based deep learning models using TensorFlow Hub:

Easy: Sentiment Analysis with BERT

Classifies text sentiment (positive/negative) using a pre-trained BERT model.

Intermediate: Named Entity Recognition (NER) with BERT

Extracts named entities (e.g., people, organizations) from text.

Advanced: Question Answering with T5 Transformer

Answers questions based on provided text context.

Expert: Text Generation with GPT-2

Generates human-like text using GPT-2.
