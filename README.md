# Keras Hub Colab Notebooks

This repository contains two Google Colab notebooks implementing small variations of Keras Hub examples across different levels: Easy, Intermediate, Advanced, and Expert.

## 📌 Notebooks Included

### 1️⃣ Image-Based Colab Notebook 🖼️
Contains implementations of various image-based deep learning models using TensorFlow Hub:

- **Easy**: Image Classification with MobileNetV2
  - Loads a pre-trained MobileNetV2 model.
  - Fine-tunes it on a small custom dataset (e.g., hand gestures, animals, etc.).
  
- **Intermediate**: Object Detection with Faster R-CNN
  - Uses the Faster R-CNN model from TensorFlow Hub.
  - Detects objects in images and returns bounding boxes and labels.
  
- **Advanced**: Super-Resolution with ESRGAN
  - Enhances low-resolution images using ESRGAN (Enhanced Super-Resolution GAN).
  
- **Expert**: StyleGAN for Image Generation
  - Generates synthetic images using a StyleGAN model.

### 2️⃣ Text-Based Colab Notebook 📝
Contains implementations of various text-based deep learning models using TensorFlow Hub:

- **Easy**: Sentiment Analysis with BERT
  - Classifies text sentiment (positive/negative) using a pre-trained BERT model.
  
- **Intermediate**: Named Entity Recognition (NER) with BERT
  - Extracts named entities (e.g., people, organizations) from text.
  
- **Advanced**: Question Answering with T5 Transformer
  - Answers questions based on provided text context.
  
- **Expert**: Text Generation with GPT-2
  - Generates human-like text using GPT-2.
